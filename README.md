## Empirical likelihood ratios applied to goodness-of-fit tests based on sample entropy

### Discription of our project 

In our project we recreated the distribution-free density-based likelihood technique, applied to test for goodness-of-fit, described in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2009.09.025). 
Authors  focus on tests for normality and uniformity. 
The well-known goodness-of-fit tests based on sample entropy are shown to be a product of the proposed empirical likelihood (EL) methodology. 
Estimation of the sample entropy has been not invariantly defined in literature, and hence this estimation produces tests that are difficult to be applied to real data studies. 
The proposed EL approach defines clear forms of the entropy-based tests. 
Monte Carlo simulation results confirm the preference of the proposed method from a power perspective.
